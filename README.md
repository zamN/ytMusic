Youtube Music!
======================

This is mainly a fun little project I started working on to learn javascript and the ruby on rails framework. 

The main inspiration behind this project was my current workplaces bandwidth. For some reason google music and amazon cloud storage don't work very well but youtube streams perfectly fine? I decided to make something that would allow me to listen to my music while at work using youtube. This is the result.

You can see a version of the latest working code here: http://rails.zamn.net. This currently only works in chrome as that is what I use at work!
